## Running Tests

All services must be running first: `task start-local`

```bash
task e2e:install              # Install dependencies + Playwright (one-time)
task e2e:test                 # Run all tests (headless)
task e2e:test:headed          # Visible browser
task e2e:test:debug           # Playwright inspector
task e2e:test:ui              # Interactive Playwright UI
task e2e:test:specific -- auth/login.spec.ts   # Specific test
task e2e:report               # View HTML report
```

## Test Coverage

| Suite | What it covers |
|-------|----------------|
| **Login** | Login page display, valid/invalid credentials, redirect after login |
| **Protected Routes** | Auth guards, redirect to login, destination preservation |
| **Chat** | Chat interface, message sending, streaming responses, input clearing |
| **User Management** | Admin creates user with unique email, new user login with temp password |
| **Navigation** | Hamburger menu across mobile (375x667), tablet (768x1024), desktop (1280x720) |

## Configuration

- **Test timeout:** 60s (180s for AI decomposition)
- **Workers:** 1 (sequential to avoid auth state conflicts)
- **Retries:** 2 in CI only
- **Traces/screenshots/video:** captured on failure
- **Browser:** Chromium only
- **Test credentials:** admin/admin

## Tech Stack

Playwright 1.48, TypeScript 5.7, dotenv for environment loading.
